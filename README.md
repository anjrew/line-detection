# 📐 Line Detection

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of line detection algorithms using computer vision.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before diving into the algorithms, make sure you have the required tools and libraries installed.

1. [Setup your development environment](./docs/setting_up_the_environment.md).
2. Take a look in the notebooks in the [src](./src/) folder to see examples of the algorithms in action.
3. Run the testing streamlit application from the root folder.
   1. Install the additional required libraries: ```pip install -r src/app/requirements.txt```
   2. Navigate the the [src folder](./src/) and run the following command:
      ```streamlit run app/main.py```
